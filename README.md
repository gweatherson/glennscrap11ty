Thank you for the wonderful foundation Chris!

This project uses 11ty and lepto mainly to generate a photo blog. On build lepto generates two sizes using `lepto-resize#retina` so separate image sizes are used for different device sizes.

The entries are liquid calls for each photo in two versions including an alt attribute. Appreciate the help on this bit @chrisssycollins!
